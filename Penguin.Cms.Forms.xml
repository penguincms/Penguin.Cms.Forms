            This class forms the basis for both Json Forms and Concrete Form implementations.
            </summary>
            As such it needs to be coded in
            a way that allows new instances of concrete forms to pretend to be json form instances. This is why it has some wonkey overrides
            to set properties that would be instance properties on Json Forms. Dont touch them unless you can replace them
